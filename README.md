Generated IGDB Typescript Client for Apicalypse Query Language

## Plans

This project should update itself automatically using the latest APIs from IGDB via Github Actions. But that's not possible yet. So you need to update the types manually.

## How To Update

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run compile`

## Credit

All credit goes to @magne4000 whom i forked this from, because he's not updating its since 2 years.
